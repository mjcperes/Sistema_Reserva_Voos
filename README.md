THIS IS MY FINAL PROJECT OF THE COMPUTER PROGRAMMER COURSE AT IEFP.
I CREATED A RESERVATION SYSTEM AT A FICTIONED AIRLINE USING C# AND WINDOWS FORMS.
WE CAN CREATE NEW ROUTES AND NEW DESTINATIONS AND SCHEDULE FLIGHTS.
THE PASSENGERS CAN MAKE RESERVATIONS ON THE SCHEDULED FLIGHTS.
THE APPLICATION ALSO PRODUCES REPORTS OF SALES WITH SEVERAL FILTERS.
THE DATABASE TABLES (MYSQL) ARE ALSO IN THE PROJECT AS WELL AS SCREENSHOTS OF THE APPLICATION.
